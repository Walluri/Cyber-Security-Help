COPRIME concept.

In number theory two integers are said to be relatively prime, mutually prime or coprime - if the only positive integer that divides both of them is 1.

14,15 are co-prime.
14,21 are not relatively prime, coz they are both divisible by 7.

There are a number of conditions  which say that a,b are co-prime.
- the LCM of a,b is equal to their product  [their product will be the least possible number which is divisible by both.]
- no prime number divides both a and b.
- there exists integers x and y such that ax+by =1 [bezouts theorem]


PRIMITIVE ROOT MODULO n.

Lets go by the example first.  [c= means congruent to ]
Number 3 is a primitive root modulo 7 because ...
3^1	=	3	=	3^0 * 3	=c	1*3	=	3	=c	3(mod7)
3^2	=	9	=	3^1 * 3	=c	3*3	=	9	=c	2(mod7)
3^3	=	27	=	3^2 * 3	=c	2*3	=	6	=c	6(mod7)
3^4	=	81	=	3^3 * 3	=c	6*3	=	18	= c	4(mod7)
3^5	=	243	=	3^4 * 3	=c	4*3	=	12	=c	5(mod7)
3^6	=	729	=	3^5 * 3	=c	5*3	=	15	=c	1(mod7)
..see that after 6 times doing this operation the numbers repeat
3^7 	=	XXX	=	3^6 * 3	=c	1*3	=	3	=c	3(mod7)
3^8	=	XXX	=	3^7 * 3	=c	3*3	=	9	=c	2(mod7)
3^9	=	XXX	=	3^8 * 3	=c	2*3	=	6	=c	6(mod7)

- Here we see that the PERIOD of 3^k modulo 7 is 6.
- the remainders in the period which are 3-2-6-4-5-1 form a re-arrangement of all non-zero remainders modulo 7.
- this implies that 3 is indeed a primitive root modulo 7.
- this derives from the fact that a sequence ( g^k modulo n ) always repeats after some value of k - since modulo n produces a finite number of values.
-  if g is a primitive root modulo n and n is prime; then the period of repetition is n-1. [ Circular shifts are created in this way.]

Here the input is 7. and the output is 3. i.e the smallest primitive root is 3

g^k = a(modn)

Definition :
If n is a positive integer; the integers between 0 and n-1 - that are co-prime to n, form a GROUP with multiplication modulo n as the operation denoted by Z^x base n.
This group of numbers is called : 'group of units modulo n' -  or 'group of primitive classes modulo n'.
This group is cyclic if and only if n is equal to 2,4,p^k,or 2p^k..where p^k is a power of a odd prime number.
A generator of this cyclic group is called a - 'primitive root modulo n' -  or a 'primitive element of Z^x base n'.

- primitive root of a prime number n is an integer r between [1 n-1] , such that the values of r^x (modn) are different. [where x is in the range [0,n-2] ]
