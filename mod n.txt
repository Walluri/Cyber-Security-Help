a = b (mod n)

Lets find out what it means.


1. 'a' and 'b' have the same 'remainder'(could be negative), when they are divided by 'n'(positive whole number greater then 1).
10 = 14 mod(4)

10/4 = remainder 2
14/4 = remainder 3


2 this can also be written in the form of an equation
a = kn + b

10 = k(4)  + 14
k = -1 in this case


3.  
    a-b = kn
    n | (a-b) = k
    a-b is a multiple of n


4 | (10-14)
4 | -4 
4 | 4(-1)
