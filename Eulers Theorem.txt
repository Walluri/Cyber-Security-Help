Eulers theorem (or Fermat-Euler theorem / Eulers totient theorem) in number theory.

First let see Eulers totient function : 
- This function counts the positive integers up to a given integer n - that are Relatively Prime to n.
- it is written using the letter phi - and may be called Eulers phi function.
- in other words this phi(n) finds all the numbers below and including nfor which the GCD is 1.
- All the numbers thus found are called totatives of n.

Eulers totient function : is a multiplicative function.
- which means that if two numbers m and n are relatively prime, then phi(mn) = phi(m)*phi(n)
- and for a prime phi(m)= (m-1) [See the primitive root modulo concept.]
 
what does it state ? : if n and a are co-prime positive integers then
