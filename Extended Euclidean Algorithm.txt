Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

To explain this we shall see an example of "Euclidean Algorithm" which is used to find the GCD of two integers.

gcd(888,54) = 6 

How ?

888 = 54(16) + 24
54 = 24(2) + 6 [is the GCD]
24 = 6(4) + 0

Now:
lets ignore the last equation express 888 and 54 in terms of the GCD 6

6 = 54 + 24(-2)

6 = 54 + (888 + 54(-16)) -2

6 = 54(1) + 888(-2)  + 54(32)

6 = 54(33) + 888(-2)


What we did here is used the result i.e GCD of the euclidean algorithm, and written the GCD as a combination of 54 and 888.

This sort of construction is called a linear combination of the 2 numbers. [will true for every pair of positive integers]

This process of working back is called : Extended Euclidean algorithm.

Thus extended Euclidean algorithm is an algorithm to compute integers x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a,b), given a,b

The Extended Euclidean algorithm can be viewed as the reciprocal of modular exponentiation.
