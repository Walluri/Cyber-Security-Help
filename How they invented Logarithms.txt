1. Jost Burgi from Switzerland
2. He multipled a lots of numbers with a lots of digits

3. multiply powers of 10 together
	1000 	*	 10000 	= 	1,0000,000
	3zeros	*	4 zeros 	= 	7 zeros
count all zeros and add : the result will have the same number of zeros

4. What if there is a way to do that for all numbers...!
    what if each number you want to multiply has a special number that went with it. [similar to the number of zeros]
    So 
 
5. lets have a table
[let take a number 1 and keep multiplying by three]
0-1
1-3
2-9
3-27
4-81
5-243
6-729
7-2187
8-6561
9-19683

With a table like this multiplying powers of three together is almost as easy multiplying powers of 10 together.

lets do 	27	*	243	=	6561

Now instead of counting zeros we look up the two numbers in the table and add the numbers that go with them.
	3 	+	 5    	=	8

Now the table tells us the value of 8 as 6561.

Matmaticians had tables like this in the 1500's

This is a table for base three.

But such tables were made for other numbers too.

They are not so useful since you can multiply only certain specific numbers with them.

6. Jost multiplied by a small number just fractionally bigger than 1.
1.00001 = 1 + 1/10000.
And he kept counting on the left just like other tables.

0-1
1-1.0001
2-1.00020001
3-1.000300030001
4-1.000400060004
.
.
.
[brute force to get this table]
By using 0.0001, this way the numbers on the right are much closer to each other.
Even if a number you wanna multiply is not there exactly in the table we can find one that closeby and get an approximation.

To keep it neat and clean Jost limited the numbers on the right to nine digits. and the left digits as Red.

7. Scotish person called John Napier also had a similar idea..he called them logarithms instead of red numbers.

8. 

lets take an example 6.0833 * 5.4987 [ This works soemthing like we did to the powers of three ]

---------------------------
0-1
1-1.0001
2-1.00020001
3-1.000300030001
4-1.000400060004
.
.
17,046-549871691
.
18,056-6.08307136
.
.
35102-33.44908733
35103-33.45243224
.
.

---------------------------

6.0833 	* 	5.4987	=	33.450

(18,056)	+ 	(17,046)	=	35102 which gets you 33.449 


the values are pretty close.
definetely accurate enough to be useful and much faster than getting the same accuracy by hand.
This magic of turning multiplication into addition is what makes logarithms as logarithms.
    we have been using them for that ever since.

9. Josts logarithms are called logs base 1.0001
    we use a lot of bases too..
    Before calculators base 10 logs were used to solve multiplication problems.
    Natural logarithms have a base of 2.718 = e.
    in fact in the beginning it does not seem like a natural base for a logarithm---but,
