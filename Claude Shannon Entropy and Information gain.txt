Entropy

1. Consider the three states of water : ice,water, wator vapour. - they have different entropies.
2. Entropy is the measure of how quickly the particles inside your object are moving.
3. 
ice - has low entropy ; as the particles move very slowly
water - medium ;
water vapour : high

4.This entropy concept occurs in maths - probability theory

Example : Lets say you have 3 buckets
bucket 1 : 4 red balls
bucket 2 : 3 red and 1 blue ball
bucket 3 : 2 red and 2 blue balls

Which one has low medium and high entropy ?
How do we find a way to measure entropy here ?
Fow now lets say that : in how many different ways can we re-arrange this set.

bucket 1 : 1 way only 
bucket 2 : If you have 4 slots and need to arrange 3 red and 1 blue in them. The number of different ways you can arrange them is below
	Blue balls can be arranged in 4C3 ways. [4 places for 3 balls]
	Red balls can be arranged in 1C1 ways. [ remaining 1 place for 1 ball]
	so total = 4!/(1!*3!) multiplied by 1!/(0!*1!) = 4*1 = 4 ways	
bucket 3 : 6 ways

In this context you can think of entropy as how much can we re-arrange this set : low medium and high.
- there is more precise way : based on information.

Explanation:
If you have to pick a random ball out the above buckets : how much do you know about the ball you are picking.
bucket 1 :  you know that you will pick a red ball - high knowledge
bucket 2 :  you know that you can pick a red ball with high probability and blue ball with less probability - medium knowledge
bucket 3 :  low knowledge

Knowledge and entropy are opposites.
bucket 1 :  low entropy
bucket 2 :  medium entropy
bucket 3 :  high entropy

5. lets device a formulae for entropy based on this concept.

5.1 we have a bucket of 3 red and 1 blue balls 
     let record what balls we draw from the bucket
     1 red - put it back
     1 red - put it back
     1 red - put it back
     1 blue - put it back
