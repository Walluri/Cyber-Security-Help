# Cyber-Security-Help

The Math and theory behind Crytography / Encryption / Hashing / openSSL.

Why ?

Claude Shannon Entropy and Information gain : 

DIFFIE HELLMAN KEY EXCHANGE : 

Euclidean Algorithm : Computational process to find the GCD of two numbers.

Eulers totient function and Eulers Theorem : 

Extended Euclidean Algorithm : 

Fermat little theorem OR Pierre De Fermat theorem : Primality test

HOW DOES RSA WORK : 

How they invented Logarithms : To multiply large numbers.

mod n : 

modular arithmetic

Primitive root modulo n : Helps to Find a Primitive root of a prime number.

Rabin-Miller Primality test : Test for a prime number.
